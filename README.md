Wellcome to my first application in Laravel.

################################
made in Laravel 7x
database: MySQL. Using PhpMyAdmin
################################

-> Import the database present in this repository and change the file ".env"

################################
what's in that application?
-> Registration of notices = As soon as they are registered, they will be presented on the screen


What was used?
-> IDE: Sublime Text 3
-> Migrations
-> Database: MySQL (PhpMyAdmin)

comments:I started with ubuntu, but several errors started to appear in relation to MySQL Workbench, so I switched to Windows and later returned to Ubuntu, with the PostGres Database
